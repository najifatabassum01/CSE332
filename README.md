# CSE332
20 bit MIPS CPU Project &amp; Lab experiments
<br>
This project involves the implementation and simulation of a 20-bit MIPS CPU using Logisim, a digital logic simulation tool. The CPU design is based on the MIPS architecture, which is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, and supports essential functionalities to execute basic instructions also following ISA format.
